class TimeEmbedding(Layer):
    """
    This class implements a sinusoidal time embedding layer. The purpose of this layer is to generate a
    time-dependent embedding vector, which can be used to encode temporal information. The embedding
    method is inspired by the positional encoding technique used in transformer models.

    Attributes:
    -----------
    @dimension : int
        The dimension of the output embedding. It should be an even number because the embedding is
        split between sine and cosine components.
    @_half_dimension : int
        Half of the embedding dimension. Used to calculate the sine and cosine components separately.
    @_embedding : Tensor
        Pre-computed scaling factors for each embedding dimension. This is based on the formula
        10000^(2i/d), where 'i' is the index and 'd' is the dimension.

    Methods:
    --------
    __init__(self, dimension, **kwargs)
        Initializes the TimeEmbedding layer, setting the embedding dimension and calculating the scaling factors.

    call(self, inputs)
        Computes the time embedding for the given inputs using sine and cosine functions. This method
        takes a tensor of inputs representing time steps and returns the corresponding embedding.

        Parameters:

            between sine and cosine components.
        **kwargs : dict
            Additional keyword arguments for the base Layer class.
