class Transformer(Layer):
    """
    Custom TensorFlow layer implementing a Transformer decoder block.

    The Transformer decoder block is a key component of the Transformer architecture,
    commonly used in sequence-to-sequence tasks such as machine translation, text generation,
    and summarization. It consists of two multi-head attention layers followed by a feedforward
    neural network. Layer normalization and dropout are applied after each step to stabilize
    training and regularize the model.

    The decoder takes both the current input sequence (decoder input) and the output from the encoder
    as inputs. It performs two types of attention:

        - 1. **Self-attention**: Attention over the decoder's own input sequence.

        - 2. **Encoder-decoder attention**: Attention over the encoder's output, allowing the decoder to focus on
            relevant parts of the encoder's context.

    Reference:
        Vaswani et al., "Attention is All You Need" (2017). The Transformer architecture introduced
        multi-head attention mechanisms and positional encodings to better capture sequential dependencies.

    Args:
        @embedding_dimension (int): The dimensionality of the input embeddings.
        @number_heads (int): The number of attention heads in the multi-head attention mechanism.
        @feedforward_dimension (int): The dimensionality of the feedforward network's hidden layer.
        @dropout_rate (float): The dropout rate applied after attention and feedforward layers. Default is 0.1.

    Attributes:
        @embedding_dimension (int): The dimensionality of the input embeddings.
        @number_heads (int): The number of attention heads in the multi-head attention mechanism.
        @feedforward_dimension (int): The dimensionality of the feedforward network's hidden layer.
        @dropout_rate (float): The dropout rate applied after attention and feedforward layers.
        @first_mult_head_attention (MultiHeadAttention): The first multi-head self-attention layer.
        @second_mult_head_attention (MultiHeadAttention): The second multi-head attention layer for attending to encoder output.
        @feedforward (Sequential): A sequential model consisting of two Dense layers.
        @first_layer_normalization (LayerNormalization): The first layer normalization applied after the first attention layer.
        @second_layer_normalization (LayerNormalization): The second layer normalization applied after the second attention layer.
        @third_layer_normalization (LayerNormalization): The third layer normalization applied after the feedforward layer.
        @first_dropout (Dropout): The dropout layer applied after the first attention output.
        @second_dropout (Dropout): The dropout layer applied after the second attention output.
        @third_dropout (Dropout): The dropout layer applied after the feedforward output.
