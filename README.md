## 📖 Overview <a name="overview"></a>

MalDataGen is a modular and extensible synthetic data generation library for tabular data for malware dectition. It aims to:

- Support state-of-the-art generative models (GANs, VAEs, Diffusion, etc.)
- Improve model generalization by augmenting training data
- Enable fair benchmarking via reproducible evaluations (TS-TR and TR-TS)
- Provide publication-ready metrics and visualizations

It supports GPU acceleration, CSV/XLS ingestion, custom CLI scripts, and integration with academic pipelines.

### Model architecure overivew
WWe provide a visual overview of the internal architecture of each model's building blocks through five detailed figures, highlighting the main structural changes across the models. These diagrams are documented and explained in the Overview.md [Overview.md ] file.(https://github.com/SBSeg25/MalDataGen/blob/2dd9eaad74da7726c130e50dbc35f95a463cbd00/Docs/Overview.md)


### 📋 Architecture Documentation

We provide a comprehensive visual overview (8 diagrams)  at [Docs/Diagrams/](Docs/Diagrams/) of the MalDataGen framework, covering its architecture, design principles, data processing flow, and evaluation strategies. Developed using Mermaid notation, these diagrams support understanding of both the structural and functional aspects of the system. They include high-level system architecture, object-oriented class relationships, evaluation workflows, training pipelines, metric frameworks, and data flow. Together, they offer a detailed and cohesive view of how MalDataGen enables the generation and assessment of synthetic data in cybersecurity contexts.

### 🚀 Run Tests

#### Demo
In order to execute a demo of the tool, utilized the comand listed below. The execution of this reduced demo takes around 3 minutes on a AMD Ryzen 7 5800x, 8 cores, 64 GB RAM machine.
 
```bash
# Run the basic demo
python3 run_campaign_sbseg.py -c sf
```

Alternatively, you can use the a docker container to execute the demo, by using the following comand:

```bash
# Run the basic demo
./run_demo_docker.sh 
```


#### Reproduction
In order to reproduce the results from the paper execute the comand below, the experiments take around 7 hours on a AMD Ryzen 7 5800x, 8 cores, 64 GB RAM machine.

```bash
# Run all experiments from the paper
python3 run_campaign_sbseg.py 
```

Or to execute with docker:
```bash
# Run all experiments from the paper
./run_experiments_docker.sh  
```

---

##### Expected outputs:
After executing the experiments, you should observe the following structure within the outputs folder, with a separate folder for each model executed:
<img width="1600" height="507" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fafb0516-c227-4aba-8596-679aeb1d68f9" />
A results folder is also present, containing the training curves for each model.

Within each model's folder, there will be five subfolders:

    - Data generated: Contains the synthetic dataset and the partitioned subsets of the real dataset used for training.

    - Evaluation results: Contains:

        - A clustering visualization of the dataset samples to assist in identifying malware families.

        - Heatmaps comparing the synthetic and real samples for each fold; these are intended to illustrate the variability of specific features, with a closer alignment indicating greater similarity.

        - Confusion matrices for each classifier on each fold.

        - A bar graph presenting the metrics for each classifier using the TSTR and TRTS evaluation methods.

    - Logs: Contains the generated logs.

    - Monitor: Contains the raw data collected during the monitoring of the experiment.

    - Models Saved: Contains the saved models for each fold, provided the option to save models was active.

Additionally, a file named "Binary classification metrics for SVM classifier.pdf" should be created in the project's root folder. This file provides a comparison of the SVM classifier's performance across the models, similar to Figure 3 in the article.
